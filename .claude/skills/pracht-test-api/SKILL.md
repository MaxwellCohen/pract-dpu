  Auto-generate Vitest request/response tests for every handler in `src/api/`.
  Each test instantiates a `Request`, calls the exported HTTP method handler
  directly, and asserts on the returned `Response` — no server boot required.
  Use when asked to "test my API routes", "scaffold API tests", "generate
  tests for src/api", or "add tests for this endpoint".

# Pracht Test API

Pracht API handlers are plain functions: `(args: ApiRouteArgs) => Response |
Promise<Response>` (`ApiRouteArgs` is `BaseRouteArgs` with `route` narrowed
to `ResolvedApiRoute`). They test cleanly in Vitest without booting the
framework.

## Step 1: Confirm Vitest is installed

If the project has no `vitest` dependency, run `scaffold-tests` first (or
prompt the user to). This skill does not handle Vitest setup.

## Step 2: Enumerate API handlers

If the pracht MCP server is registered (see docs/MCP.md), prefer its tools
(`inspect_routes`, `inspect_api`, `inspect_build`, `doctor`, `verify`,
`generate_*`) over shelling out. Prerequisite: `pracht inspect` needs a vite
config with the pracht plugin registered.

```bash
pracht inspect api --json
```

For each entry, capture: `path` (URL), `file` (source path), and the exported
`methods` (e.g., `["GET", "POST"]`). Note: `methods` only lists named HTTP
method exports — a default-export dispatcher yields `methods: []`, never
`["default"]`. Current `@pracht/cli` versions also report a
`hasDefaultHandler` boolean; use it when present. If the field is absent
(older CLI) and `methods` is empty, fall back to the grep in Step 7 to detect
a default dispatcher.

Ask the user which subset to scaffold or accept paths via `$ARGUMENTS`.

## Step 3: Generate one test per handler file

Place tests next to the handler with `.test.ts` suffix
(`src/api/users/[id].test.ts`). Use `createApiArgs()` from `@pracht/test`
(add it as a dev dependency if missing) to construct `ApiRouteArgs`:

```ts
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest";
import { createApiArgs, readJson } from "@pracht/test";
import { GET, POST /* import only what the handler exports */ } from "./<file>";

describe("<METHOD> <api-path>", () => {
  it("returns 200 on a valid request", async () => {
    const res = await GET(createApiArgs({ url: "<api-path>" }));
    expect(res).toBeInstanceOf(Response);
    expect(res.status).toBe(200);
  });
});
```

Pass `params` for dynamic segments, `body` for JSON payloads (plain objects
are JSON-encoded with the right `Content-Type`), and use `submitForm()` for
form-encoded/multipart POSTs — it drives the same `FormData` parsing path
`defineApi()` uses.

## Step 4: Generate method-specific cases

For each exported method, emit the smallest realistic case:

| Method  | Default case                                                    |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`   | Plain GET → `expect(res.status).toBeLessThan(400)`              |
| `POST`  | POST with empty `FormData` → assert validation behavior         |
| `PUT`   | PUT with JSON body → assert 200 or auth-required (401/403)      |
| `PATCH` | PATCH with partial body → assert 200 or 422                     |
| `DELETE`| DELETE on a real-shaped path → assert 200/204 or 401            |

For dynamic segments (`[id].ts` → `/api/users/:id`), pick a placeholder param
(e.g., `id: "test-1"`) and pass it via `params`. Surface in the report that
the user may need to provide a real fixture.

## Step 5: Detect auth-gated APIs

API routes do NOT appear in `pracht inspect routes --json` (that report
covers page routes only) and `pracht inspect api --json` has no middleware
field. API middleware is the single global list configured as
`defineApp({ api: { middleware: [...] } })` — read the manifest source
(`src/routes.ts` or wherever `defineApp` lives) to see whether an auth
middleware is in that list. If it is, scaffold an extra test:

```ts
it("rejects unauthenticated requests", async () => {
  const res = await POST(createApiArgs({ url: "<api-path>", method: "POST" }));
  expect([401, 403, 302]).toContain(res.status);
});
```

Note: middleware does NOT run when calling the handler directly — this test
verifies the handler's own defense if it has one. If the only defense is
middleware, mention that in the report and recommend an integration test that
goes through the framework's request pipeline (out of scope for this skill).
The same applies to the framework's built-in CSRF check: `requireSameOrigin`
(on by default) rejects cross-origin state-changing API requests in the real
pipeline but never runs in direct-invocation tests.

## Step 6: Validate JSON shape

For handlers that return `Response.json(...)`, generate:

```ts
it("returns JSON with the expected keys", async () => {
  const res = await GET(createApiArgs({ url: "<api-path>" }));
  expect(res.headers.get("content-type")).toMatch(/application\/json/);
  const body = await readJson(res);
  expect(body).toEqual(expect.objectContaining({ /* fill in */ }));
});
```

## Step 7: Default-handler dispatchers

If the handler exports `default` (one function dispatching on
`request.method`), generate a test per HTTP method the handler appears to
support (grep for `request.method ===` patterns inside the file).

## Step 8: Run

```bash
pnpm test
pracht verify --json
```

Report passes/failures. Mark generated assertions as TODO so the user knows
to tighten them.

## Rules

1. Use `pracht inspect api --json` as the inventory — do not glob.
2. Only import methods the handler actually exports; otherwise the test fails
   to load.
3. Direct-handler invocation skips middleware AND the default-on
   `requireSameOrigin` CSRF check. Be explicit in the report.
4. Test files live next to handlers with `.test.ts` suffix unless the
   project already uses a `__tests__/` convention (detect and match).
5. Never overwrite existing test files; emit a `.next.test.ts` and tell the
   user to merge.
