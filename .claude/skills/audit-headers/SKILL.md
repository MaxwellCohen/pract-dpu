# Pracht Audit Headers

What the framework guarantees: four default security headers are applied
automatically on EVERY framework response path — SSR pages, API responses,
404s, and static/ISG output on the first-party adapters (`adapter-node`,
`adapter-cloudflare`) as well as the Vercel headers config generated at build
time:

- `permissions-policy` (disables device sensors)
- `referrer-policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `x-content-type-options: nosniff`
- `x-frame-options: SAMEORIGIN`

The helper behind this (`applyDefaultSecurityHeaders`) only sets a header
**when missing** — so a route or shell `headers()` export always wins,
including when it weakens a default. The framework does NOT set
`strict-transport-security`, `content-security-policy`, or `cross-origin-*`
headers — those need a project decision.

One deliberate exception: **protocol-switch responses** (a `101` WebSocket
handshake, or any response carrying a `webSocket` handle) are returned exactly
as the handler produced them, with no headers applied. This is not a gap —
copying the response would destroy the socket, and a handshake has no body for
a sniffing or framing policy to protect. Do not report it as a finding.

The audit surface is therefore:

- **(a)** `dist/client` served by a custom CDN/host outside the first-party
  adapters — nothing applies the defaults there.
- **(b)** `headers()` exports that override a default with a weaker value.
- **(c)** HSTS and CSP, which genuinely need user action.

Prerequisites: `pracht inspect` requires a vite config that registers the
pracht plugin; `pracht inspect build` and
`dist/server/headers-manifest.json` require a prior `pracht build`. Every
serverful target currently publishes a client copy at
`dist/client/_pracht/headers.json`; only Cloudflare reads it there. Pure static
exports deliberately do not publish that copy.

## Step 1: Inventory header sources

```bash
pracht inspect routes --json
pracht inspect api --json
```

If the pracht MCP server is registered (see `docs/MCP.md`), prefer its tools
(`inspect_routes`, `inspect_api`, `inspect_build`, `doctor`, `verify`) over
shelling out.

Only route modules and shells have a `headers()` export — API handlers do not
(there is no `headers` in the API module shape; API handlers set headers
inline on the `Response` they build, and the runtime applies the defaults on
top). Inventory:

- `headers()` exports in route files, loader files (`loaderFile`), and shells
  (`shellFile`).
- Hand-rolled `Response` constructions in API handlers and middleware where
  security-relevant headers are set inline.

## Step 2: Find weakened defaults and uncovered static hosting

Defaults are framework-applied, so do not build a "which route is covered"
matrix — instead:

1. For each `headers()` source from Step 1, flag any of the four default
   header names set to a weaker value (e.g. `x-frame-options: ALLOWALL`,
   an over-permissive `permissions-policy`, `referrer-policy: unsafe-url`).
   Because the defaults are set-when-missing, the route value wins.
2. Ask how `dist/client` is deployed. On `adapter-node`, `adapter-cloudflare`,
   or the generated Vercel config, static/ISG responses get the defaults. If
   a custom CDN or host serves `dist/client` directly, flag it (`warn`) and
   recommend replicating the four defaults in that host's header config.

## Step 3: HSTS

Grep for `strict-transport-security`. If absent everywhere, recommend adding
it (e.g. via a shell `headers()` export or the host's config):

```ts
"strict-transport-security": "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload"
```

Only recommend `preload` if the user confirms they want to commit to HTTPS
permanently and submit to the preload list.

## Step 4: Content-Security-Policy

Start from the canonical starter policy in `docs/CSP.md` — it includes
`'inline-speculation-rules'` in `script-src`, required for routes that opt
into `speculation` (they emit an inline
`<script type="speculationrules">`). Then add observed origins:

1. Check which routes use `speculation`: read the `speculation` field from
   `pracht inspect routes --json` (requires a current `@pracht/cli`; on older
   CLIs, grep the manifest for `speculation:` instead). If none do,
   `'inline-speculation-rules'` can be dropped.
2. Grep the app for fetch URLs, image URLs, CSS `@import`, `<script src>`,
   `<link href>`, font URLs, iframe sources.
3. Group by directive: `default-src`, `script-src`, `style-src`, `img-src`,
   `font-src`, `connect-src`, `frame-src`; always include `'self'` per
   directive, per the starter policy.
4. Pracht injects hydration state in a non-executable
   `<script id="pracht-state" type="application/json">` — it does not need
   `'unsafe-inline'`. Do not add `'unsafe-inline'` unless the app truly emits
   executable inline scripts and the tradeoff is documented.

Output a draft CSP referencing `docs/CSP.md` and explain what each origin is
for. Do not hand the user a CSP that breaks their site — present as draft.

## Step 5: Prerendered header manifest safety

For SSG/ISG output, the framework refuses to prerender any route whose
document headers include dangerous names (`set-cookie`, `authorization`,
`proxy-authorization`, `www-authenticate`, `proxy-authenticate`) or
secret-shaped custom `x-*` names (token/secret/key/credential patterns) — a
build containing them hard-fails. So do not hunt for those at runtime; audit
the `headers()` sources statically to catch them **before** a build failure,
and report each as `error` with the prerender failure it would cause.

The real target is the `warn` class the framework cannot catch: innocuously
named headers carrying user-specific values in
`dist/server/headers-manifest.json`, which serverful adapters may replay across
users on static responses. Every serverful build currently also copies that
manifest into public client output; Cloudflare reads it through the assets
binding, while the other adapters retain the public copy for compatibility. A
pure static export omits the client copy and has no runtime to replay the server
manifest; instead, verify that the deployment's host-header configuration
mirrors only safe, non-user-specific entries. Missing host configuration means
route `headers()` values are not applied at all.

Secret VALUES in headers are owned by `audit-secrets`; this skill owns policy
headers. Cross-reference `audit-secrets` for value-level findings.

## Step 6: Cross-origin isolation (optional)

If the user mentions `SharedArrayBuffer`, WASM threading, or high-precision
timers, recommend:

- `cross-origin-opener-policy: same-origin`
- `cross-origin-embedder-policy: require-corp`
- `cross-origin-resource-policy: same-origin` on assets

Otherwise leave these unset — they break embedded third-party content.

## Step 7: Report

Two outputs:

1. **Findings table** (source × header × severity).
2. **Recommendations**, in priority order:
   - `error`: `headers()` values that would fail prerender (Step 5).
   - `error`: `headers()` exports that weaken a default.
   - `warn`: `dist/client` served by a host that does not apply the defaults.
   - `warn`: Missing HSTS in production-grade apps.
   - `warn`: User-specific headers in prerendered static output.
   - `info`: CSP draft, COOP/COEP suggestions.

Show the exact code change required (e.g. the `headers()` export to fix, or
the CDN header config to add).

## Rules

1. The four defaults are framework-applied — do not recommend re-adding them
   in app code; audit for weakening and for hosting paths outside the
   first-party adapters.
2. Never recommend a CSP with `'unsafe-eval'` unless the user has documented
   why they need it.
3. `applyDefaultSecurityHeaders` is set-when-missing, so per-route `headers()`
   wins over the defaults — weakened values are the primary finding, not
   missing ones.
4. Static/ISG responses already get the defaults on first-party adapters and
   the generated Vercel config; only flag static hosting that bypasses those.
5. Treat prerender header manifests as public artifacts.
6. Do not auto-edit. Headers are policy; surface gaps, propose patches.
