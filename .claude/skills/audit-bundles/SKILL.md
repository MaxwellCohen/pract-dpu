# Pracht Audit Bundles

Pracht performs route-level code splitting via the Vite plugin and emits a
manifest. This skill reads that manifest, sizes each route's client payload,
and surfaces the worst offenders.

## Step 1: Build with analysis

If the pracht MCP server is registered (see docs/MCP.md), prefer its tools
(`inspect_routes`, `inspect_api`, `inspect_build`, `doctor`, `verify`) over
shelling out. Prerequisites: `pracht inspect` needs a vite config with the
pracht plugin; `pracht inspect build` reads artifacts from a prior
`pracht build`.

```bash
pracht build --analyze --json
```

This is the native per-route payload report: for every route (pattern + render
mode) it emits the transitive client JS chunks with raw and gzip sizes
(`routes[].chunks`), route-specific and total sums (`routeGzipBytes`,
`totalGzipBytes`), and the shared entry chunks broken out (`shared`), sorted by
total gzip descending. A stale `dist/` produces misleading numbers — rebuild,
don't reuse.

Exit-code footgun: when configured budgets fail, `pracht build --analyze
--json` sets a nonzero exit code while still printing valid JSON on stdout.
Do not treat exit 1 as "no output" — parse stdout anyway, or run with
`--no-budget-fail` to keep the exit code clean.

For a human-readable table, use `pracht build --analyze` instead.

## Step 2: Pull supporting metadata

```bash
pracht inspect build --json
```

Captures the resolved adapter, client entry URL, and CSS/JS manifest. Cross
reference with `dist/client/.vite/manifest.json` for chunk metadata
(file, imports, dynamicImports, css, isEntry) — needed for vendor fan-in
analysis (Step 4) and CSS sizing, which the analyze report does not cover.

## Step 3: Interpret per-route payload

From the Step 1 JSON, report:

| Route | Hydration | Route JS (gz) | Shared (gz) | Total (gz) | CSS (gz) | LCP-class? |
| ----- | --------- | ------------- | ----------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------- |

`gz` = gzip size, taken directly from `routeGzipBytes` / `shared.gzipBytes` /
`totalGzipBytes`. Size CSS chunks (from `cssManifest`) with `zlib.gzipSync`.

Account for the per-route `hydration` field the analyze JSON emits (omitted
means `"full"`) before judging sizes:

- `hydration: "none"` routes ship **0 bytes** of JS — the report already
  zeroes them out. Never flag them.
- `hydration: "islands"` routes never load the shared client entry; their
  total is the islands bootstrap plus **every** island chunk in the app — an
  upper bound, since which islands a page actually uses is only known at
  render time. Treat their totals as pessimistic.
- Only `"full"` routes pay route JS + shared entry.

`LCP-class?` is `yes` when total gz exceeds 200 KB — that's the order of
magnitude where mid-tier mobile starts losing LCP budget. Apply the threshold
after the hydration adjustment above.

If the app declares `budgets` in the pracht plugin config, the Step 1 JSON also
contains a `budgets` section with per-route pass/fail — lead the report with any
failures. If no budgets are configured, suggest adding them (see
docs/PERFORMANCE.md), starting from the current sizes plus ~10% headroom.

## Step 4: Vendor chunk health

Identify chunks under `node_modules/`. For each:
- Size (raw and gz).
- Number of route chunks that import it (fan-in).

A vendor chunk imported by every route is the framework runtime — expected.
A vendor chunk imported by ONE route is a code-splitting opportunity (move
the import inside that route's component or lazy-load it).

A vendor chunk over 100 KB gz that is imported by every route is worth a
manual review — common offenders: date libraries, validation libraries,
icon sets, charting libraries.

## Step 5: Heavy dependencies in route components

For each route chunk over 50 KB gz, run `pracht inspect build --json` plus
`du`-style analysis on the chunk contents:

- Grep the chunk source for known heavy module headers (`moment`, `lodash`,
  `chart.js`, `three`, `@stripe/stripe-js`, etc.).
- For each, recommend: (a) tree-shakeable alternative, (b) dynamic import
  inside an event handler, (c) lazy-load via `lazy()` from `preact-suspense`.

## Step 6: Prefetch strategy

`pracht inspect routes --json` exposes `prefetch` per route on a current
`@pracht/cli`. If your CLI version predates the field (it's absent from the
JSON), fall back to grepping the route manifest source for `prefetch:`.
Route-level strategies are `"none"`, `"hover"`, `"intent"`, `"viewport"`
(`"render"` exists only as a per-link override — see below). Recommend:

- `"viewport"` for primary-nav links.
- `"hover"` for content links inside long pages.
- `"intent"` (default) is fine if you're not sure.
- `"none"` for routes that are large and rarely visited (admin, settings) so
  hover doesn't preload them.

Cost model for `"viewport"`: the IntersectionObserver fires once per anchor —
it unobserves the anchor after the first prefetch, and prefetched route state
is cached for 30 seconds — so a link in a marketing footer costs at most one
prefetch per anchor per page view, not one per scroll. It's still wasteful
for a 300 KB route that footer visitors rarely click; prefer `"none"` or
`"hover"` there. Also note the per-link escape hatch: `<Link prefetch="...">`
overrides the route-level strategy for a single anchor (and accepts the extra
`"render"` value — prefetch as soon as the link renders, the most eager
option), so a route can stay on `"intent"` while its primary-nav link opts
into `"viewport"` or `"render"`.

If every route ends up on `"none"`, do not stop there — the prefetch listeners
still ship, in a chunk the router lazily imports on every page. Recommend
`pracht({ client: { prefetch: false } })` instead, which compiles the whole
mechanism out (~2.6 KB gzip and one fewer request). Confirm nothing relies on
prefetching first: the router silently stops honouring `route({ prefetch })` and
`<Link prefetch>`, and the imperative `prefetch()` export becomes a no-op. See
`docs/PERFORMANCE.md#switching-off-js-prefetching`.

## Step 7: Report

Three sections:

1. **Top 10 routes by total client payload** — sorted desc.
2. **Top 10 vendor chunks by size** — with fan-in.
3. **Suggestions** — ordered by impact (KB saved × routes affected).

Tag every finding with a primary severity — `error` (budget failure), `warn`
(LCP-class route, single-route vendor chunk), `info` (tuning opportunity) —
and keep the size numbers as supporting detail.

Include before/after estimates for each suggestion: "Lazy-load `chart.js`
inside `Component`: -180 KB gz off `/dashboard/analytics`."

## Rules

1. Always run `pracht build --analyze --json` first. A stale build is a source
   of bad advice.
2. Use the Vite manifest as the source of truth — chunk names rotate per
   build.
3. Report gzip size, not raw — the wire size is what users pay.
4. Distinguish "shared" code (entry + framework) from "route-specific" code
   when reporting; users can only optimize the latter.
5. Do not auto-edit. Bundle changes have render-blocking implications;
   surface and let the user choose.
