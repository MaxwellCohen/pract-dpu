# Pracht Upgrade

Upgrade `@pracht/*` dependencies with the changelog read *before* the install,
not after the build breaks.

## Step 1: Inventory

List every installed pracht package and its resolved version:

```bash
pnpm list --depth 1 --json | grep -A2 '@pracht/'   # or read package.json + lockfile
```

The family: `@pracht/core`, `@pracht/cli`, `@pracht/vite-plugin`,
`@pracht/adapter-node`, `@pracht/adapter-cloudflare`, `@pracht/adapter-vercel`,
`@pracht/preact-ssr-precompile`, `@pracht/content`, `@pracht/markdown`,
`@pracht/image`. Get the latest published versions with
`npm view <pkg> version`.

## Step 2: Understand the versioning model

Pracht packages are **independently versioned** (the repo's changesets config
has empty `fixed`/`linked` groups) — `@pracht/core` can be at 0.9.x while
`@pracht/cli` is at 1.6.x. There is no "one framework version". Two
consequences:

1. **Internal dependencies are pinned exact.** Published packages depend on
   their siblings at exact versions (e.g. `@pracht/vite-plugin@0.5.0` depends
   on `@pracht/core@0.9.0`, not a range). Upgrade the whole family in one
   move; upgrading only one package can drag in a second copy of
   `@pracht/core` and split the runtime.
2. **Most packages are 0.x**, so under semver a *minor* bump may be breaking —
   treat `### Minor Changes` entries on 0.x packages with the same care as
   majors.

After any upgrade, confirm a single core resolution:

```bash
pnpm why @pracht/core   # exactly one version may appear
```

## Step 3: Read the changelogs between installed and target

Only `@pracht/cli` ships `CHANGELOG.md` in its npm tarball
(`node_modules/@pracht/cli/CHANGELOG.md`); the other packages publish `dist/`
only. Fetch their changelogs from the repo instead:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/main/packages/<dir>/CHANGELOG.md
```

| Package | Repo directory |
| ------- | -------------- |
| `@pracht/core` | `packages/framework` |
| `@pracht/cli` | `packages/cli` |
| `@pracht/vite-plugin` | `packages/vite-plugin` |
| `@pracht/adapter-node` / `-cloudflare` / `-vercel` | `packages/adapter-*` |
| `@pracht/preact-ssr-precompile` | `packages/preact-ssr-precompile` |
| `@pracht/content` | `packages/content` |
| `@pracht/markdown` | `packages/markdown` |
| `@pracht/image` | `packages/image` |

Changelogs are changesets-generated: `## X.Y.Z` sections containing
`### Major Changes` / `### Minor Changes` / `### Patch Changes`. Read every
section between the installed and target version of every installed package.

## Step 4: Map changes onto this app

Classify each entry as **breaking** / **feature** / **fix**. For each breaking
(or 0.x minor) entry, grep the app for the APIs, exports, config options, and
generated-file shapes it names, and record: affected files, the migration the
changelog prescribes, and whether it can be applied mechanically. Also
re-check peer ranges after a major target bump — `@pracht/vite-plugin`
requires `vite` (^8), `@pracht/adapter-cloudflare` requires `vite` and
`wrangler` (^4.81), `@pracht/core` requires `preact` (^10) and
`preact-render-to-string` (^6).

Present the plan as a table:

| Package | Installed → Target | Breaking entries | App impact | Migration |
| ------- | ------------------ | ---------------- | ---------- | --------- |

## Step 5: Confirm, then apply

Use `AskUserQuestion` before touching anything when breaking migrations are
required: confirm the target versions and which migrations to apply. Then:

```bash
pnpm up '@pracht/core@<v>' '@pracht/cli@<v>' '@pracht/vite-plugin@<v>' <adapters...>
```

Upgrade every installed `@pracht/*` package in the same command. Apply the
agreed code migrations with minimal diffs, one changelog entry at a time.

## Step 6: Verification ladder

Run in order; stop and fix at the first failure:

```bash
pracht doctor --json          # wiring still valid
pracht typegen --check        # generated route types up to date?
pracht typegen                # regenerate if --check failed or routes changed
pracht verify --json          # framework-aware checks
pracht build                  # full production build (budgets included)
pnpm test                     # the app's own suite
```

`pracht doctor`, `verify`, and `typegen --check` exit non-zero on failure, so
they gate CI cleanly.

## Step 7: Rollback note

If the ladder cannot be made green, roll back rather than shipping a
half-upgrade:

```bash
git restore package.json pnpm-lock.yaml && pnpm install
git checkout -- <migrated files>   # or revert the upgrade commit
```

Because internal deps are exact-pinned, a *partial* rollback (one package
back, the rest forward) recreates the duplicate-core problem from Step 2 —
roll the whole family back together.

## Rules

1. Never mix `@pracht/*` versions from different release waves — upgrade and
   roll back the family as a unit, and verify with `pnpm why @pracht/core`.
2. Read changelogs before installing, not after something breaks.
3. Never apply a breaking-change migration without explicit user confirmation
   via `AskUserQuestion`.
4. Treat 0.x minor bumps as potentially breaking.
5. Do not hand-edit lockfiles; let the package manager resolve.
