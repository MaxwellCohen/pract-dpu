# Pracht Debug

Framework-aware debugging for pracht applications — a full-stack Preact framework built on Vite.

The user will describe a symptom (error, unexpected behavior, blank page, etc.). Investigate systematically using the checklist below, stopping when you find the root cause.

Before deep manual inspection, prefer running `pracht verify` (add `--changed` to scope the checks to git-changed files) for a fast agent loop or `pracht doctor` when the problem could be caused by broader broken app wiring or missing files.
When another agent/tool needs the framework's resolved graph, prefer `pracht inspect routes --json`, `pracht inspect api --json`, or `pracht inspect build --json` over reconstructing it from source files. Prerequisites: `pracht inspect` needs the pracht plugin registered in the project's vite config, and `pracht inspect build` needs a prior `pracht build`.
If the pracht MCP server is registered (docs/MCP.md), prefer the `inspect_routes`/`inspect_api`/`doctor`/`verify` MCP tools over shelling out — same payloads, structured results.
While the dev server is running, `GET /_pracht` serves a devtools page with the same resolved route/API graph (raw JSON at `/_pracht.json`) — useful when you have a browser or `curl` handy but no CLI access. Under a Vite deploy base, prefix both paths with that base; links from the devtools and dev-404 pages already do so. Dev SSR responses also carry a `Server-Timing` header (`mw`, `loader`, `render` durations in ms) — check it in the browser Network panel or with `curl -sI` to see which phase makes a route slow.

## Iron Law

**NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST.**

## Debugging Checklist

Work through these in order, stopping when you find the root cause:

### 1. Route matching

- Run `pracht verify --changed` first if you want a cheap changed-file confidence check.
- Run `pracht doctor` if the route might be missing, miswired, or pointing at a missing module across the project.
- For machine-readable route wiring, run `pracht inspect routes --json`. With a running dev server, `curl http://localhost:5173/_pracht.json` returns the same graph.
- Read `src/routes.ts` — is the route defined? Is the path correct?
- Check for typos in file paths (the manifest uses relative paths like `"./routes/home.tsx"`).
- For dynamic segments, verify bracket syntax: `route("/users/:id", ...)` in manifest, `[id].ts` in filenames.
- Grep for the route path across the manifest and check `matchAppRoute()` logic if needed.

### 2. Typed route/link issues

- If `<Link route="...">`, `href("...")`, or route-object `useNavigate()` fails to typecheck, run `pracht typegen --check` to detect stale generated files.
- Run `pracht inspect routes --json` and confirm the route id exists. If it is a fallback id, remember path changes can rename it.
- Check generated `src/pracht.d.ts` for inferred params. `:id`, `*`, and `:path*` params are required; extra params should fail at typecheck time.
- If runtime navigation throws `Unknown pracht route id "..."`, in dev the error includes a `Did you mean "..."?` suggestion and the list of registered route ids (production builds tree-shake this and throw the bare error) — check for a typo first, then ensure `pracht typegen` was run and the component is rendered inside the pracht route tree.
- For unexpected URLs, reproduce with `href(routeId, options)` and compare against the route's resolved path and params.

### 3. Loader / API route errors

- For slow pages, read the dev `Server-Timing` response header (`mw`/`loader`/`render` in ms) to see which phase dominates before reading code.
- Read the route module's `loader` function or the matching API route handler.
- Check that `loader` returns serializable data (no functions, no circular refs).
- Check that API route handlers return `Response` objects and branch on `request.method` when using a default export.
- Look for unhandled promise rejections or thrown errors.
- Verify `LoaderArgs` destructuring matches what the framework provides: `{ request, params, context, signal, url, route }`.

### 4. Rendering issues

- **Blank page**: Check if the route has `render: "spa"` (no SSR content expected) vs `"ssr"`.
- **Hydration mismatch**: In dev, pracht surfaces a fixed-position red banner at the top of the page listing each mismatched component (via Preact's `options.__m` hook). Compare server-rendered HTML vs client component output. Common causes:
  - Date/time rendering differences
  - Browser-only APIs used during SSR (`window`, `document`, `localStorage`)
  - Conditional rendering based on client state
  - Two copies of `@pracht/core` in the SSR module graph. The tell is that
    `useLocation()` returns `/`, `useParams()` returns `{}`, and
    `useRouteData()` returns `undefined` in the server-rendered HTML for
    *every* page, while the hydrated client is correct — the provider and the
    hooks hold different `createContext()` objects. The plugin prevents this by
    keeping `@pracht/*` in `ssr.noExternal` (dev and build alike); listing a
    `@pracht/*` package in `ssr.external` overrides that and brings the split
    back.
- **Missing shell**: Referencing an unregistered shell name throws at manifest resolution — `Unknown shell "..." for route "...". Did you mean "..."? Registered shells: ...` — and shows up in the dev error overlay as soon as the server loads the manifest. Verify the shell is registered in `defineApp({ shells: { ... } })` and assigned to the route/group.
- **404 page**: Route not matched — check manifest wiring (step 1). In `pracht dev`, unmatched navigations render a dev-only 404 page listing every registered route with its render mode; compare the requested path against that table. The route table is also printed on dev-server startup and available via `pracht inspect routes`. Apps that declare `defineApp({ notFound })` render their own 404 page instead (in dev and production alike), so the route table is not shown — check `pracht inspect routes` directly. A 404 on a URL you *do* expect to work usually means the loader threw `notFound()`, not that matching failed.

### 5. Middleware issues

- Verify middleware is registered in `defineApp({ middleware: { ... } })`. An
  unregistered name (on a route, group, or `api.middleware`) throws at manifest
  resolution — `Unknown middleware "..." for route "...". Did you mean "..."? Registered middleware: ...`
- Verify middleware is applied to the route/group: `middleware: ["name"]`.
- Middleware is wrap-around: it must always return a `Response`, either by
  calling `await next()` (to continue down the chain) or short-circuiting.
- Common bugs:
  - Forgetting `return next()` → `Middleware "..." did not return a Response`
  - Calling `next()` twice → `Middleware "..." called next() multiple times`
  - Mutating a non-object `context` → mutations don't propagate; always pass
    an object as the request context.
- Middleware runs server-side only, wrapping loaders and API handlers.

### 6. API route issues

- API routes live in `src/api/` and are auto-discovered (no manifest entry needed).
- For machine-readable API inventory, run `pracht inspect api --json`.
- File path maps to URL: `src/api/health.ts` → `/api/health`, `src/api/users/[id].ts` → `/api/users/:id`.
- Each file exports named HTTP method handlers (`GET`, `POST`, etc.) or one default handler.
- Missing method handler → 405 response when there is no default handler.
- Default handlers receive the same route args and can branch on `request.method`.
- Handlers must return `Response` objects.

### 7. Vite plugin / HMR issues

- Check `vite.config.ts` — is `pracht()` plugin included?
- Virtual modules: `virtual:pracht/client` (hydration), `virtual:pracht/server` (SSR), `virtual:pracht/islands-client` (islands hydration).
- HMR: changes to `src/routes.ts` restart the dev server (`server.restart()`, not a browser-side full reload); changes to route/shell/middleware/API/server/islands files invalidate the server module.
- If HMR seems broken, check that the file is in one of the watched directories (`src/routes/`, `src/shells/`, `src/middleware/`, `src/api/`, `src/server/`, `src/islands/`).

### 8. Build / deployment issues

- `pracht build` runs client + server builds, then prerenders SSG/ISG routes.
- `pracht preview` builds and serves the production output locally (Node runs `dist/server/server.js`, Cloudflare delegates to `wrangler dev`).
- `pracht inspect build --json` reports the resolved adapter target plus client/CSS/JS manifests from the latest build output (requires a prior `pracht build`).
- Check `dist/client/` for client assets and `dist/server/` for server bundle.
- ISG manifest: `dist/server/isg-manifest.json`. On Cloudflare the build also copies it to `dist/client/_pracht/isg.json` for the worker runtime to read via the assets binding.
- Adapter mismatch: ensure `pracht({ adapter: nodeAdapter() })` or `cloudflareAdapter()` matches deployment target.

## Framework Internals

- `handlePrachtRequest()` dispatches: API routes → middleware → loader → render → HTML assembly
- Route state JSON: returned when `x-pracht-route-state-request` header is present (client-side navigation)
- Hydration state: injected as `window.__PRACHT_STATE__` in the HTML
- Client router: `initClientRouter()` intercepts link clicks and fetches route state JSON

## Rules

1. Always read the relevant source files before diagnosing.
2. Start with the most likely cause based on the symptom, not a full audit.
3. When you find the root cause, explain _why_ it breaks and fix it.
4. If wiring looks suspicious, run `pracht verify` first, then `pracht doctor` if you need the full-project view. If running the dev server or tests would help, do so (`pracht dev`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm e2e`).
5. After fixing, verify the fix works (run relevant test or check dev server output).
6. Never say "this should fix it." Verify and prove it.
