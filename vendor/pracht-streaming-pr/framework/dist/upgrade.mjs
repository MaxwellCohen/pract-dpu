/**
* True when `request` is a WebSocket upgrade handshake (`Upgrade: websocket`).
*
* Use it at the top of an API route that serves WebSockets to reject plain
* HTTP requests with `426 Upgrade Required` instead of hanging them:
*
* ```ts
* export function GET({ request }: BaseRouteArgs) {
*   if (!isUpgradeRequest(request)) {
*     return new Response("Expected a WebSocket upgrade", { status: 426 });
*   }
*   // Cloudflare: new WebSocketPair() / forward to a Durable Object.
* }
* ```
*
* The `Upgrade` header is a comma-separated protocol list, so this matches
* `websocket` as a token (case-insensitively) rather than comparing the raw
* header value. Note the framework's same-origin guard for upgrades
* (`api.requireSameOrigin`, on by default) runs before any API route —
* browsers do not apply CORS to WebSocket, so keep that guard on unless you
* check `Origin` yourself.
