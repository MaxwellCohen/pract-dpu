/**
* Dev-only: refresh route data after a route or shell module Fast Refreshes.
*
* Fast Refresh patches the component in place, which is exactly what it should
* do — and exactly why the page is now wrong when the edit touched server-only
* code. A route module's `loader`, `head`, `headers`, and `getStaticPaths` are
* stripped out of the browser copy, so an edit to any of them changes what the
* server would send while the open document keeps the data it was rendered
* with. Before Fast Refresh reached route modules this was invisible: every
* route edit reloaded the document, which fetched the new data as a side
* effect.
*
* Re-fetching route state gives back loader data and font state without giving
* up what Fast Refresh bought. Modules that own document `headers()` reload
* instead because a fetch cannot update the active document's response
* headers. Other `head()` output is deliberately not re-applied: head metadata
* is server-rendered and does not follow the client router, and dev matching
* production matters more than a fresh `<title>` here.
*
* The listener is installed by the generated client entry (the only module in
* the graph with an `import.meta.hot` of its own), and the whole path is dead
* code in a production build.
