* Static-export target support shared by the client runtime and the server
* renderer.
*
* `@pracht/adapter-static` builds ship no server, so the client cannot fetch
* route-state JSON from the page URL (there is nothing to answer the
* `x-pracht-route-state-request` header). Instead, `pracht build` serializes
* every prerendered route's loader payload to a static JSON file under
* `/_pracht/state/…`, and the client fetches that file during navigation.
*
* The switch is a compile-time define (`__PRACHT_STATIC_TARGET__`) injected by
* `@pracht/vite-plugin` when the configured adapter declares
* `staticTarget: true`. Every other adapter gets `false`, so the static
* branches are dead-code-eliminated from their bundles. The `typeof` guard
* keeps the module loadable in environments without the define (unit tests,
* direct Node imports).

/**
* Map a request URL (path + optional query) to its static route-state file.
*
* The scheme uses opaque hexadecimal components for every URL segment and a
* reserved `_state.json` leaf — `/` → `/_pracht/state/index.json`, while
* `/blog/hello` maps to two encoded directories plus the leaf. Long encoded
* segments are split across bounded continuation components, so otherwise
* valid route params cannot exceed a filesystem's per-component name limit.
* The `s-` (segment) / `c-` (continuation) markers keep the mapping injective,
* including `/docs` versus `/docs/index.json`.
*
* The query string is dropped deliberately: static loader data was produced
* at build time from the bare pathname, so every query variant of a URL maps
* to the same payload (exactly what the build generated).
*
* HTML goes to the *decoded* path (`/posts/caf%C3%A9` →
* `posts/café/index.html`) because hosts decode before the filesystem lookup.
* State files canonicalize each segment to the encoding produced by
* `encodeURIComponent()` before hex-encoding it. The build and client therefore
* agree for raw Unicode, lowercase percent escapes, and escaped unreserved
* characters that identify the same URL path. The resulting component names
* are pure ASCII hex, so host decoding cannot affect them either way.
